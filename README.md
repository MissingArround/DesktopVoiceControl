# DesktopVoiceControl

This is a small project that we are working on. We’re trying to create a service that allows users to control their desktop using their voice. This could include opening applications, opening files, and deleting files.

We’re doing this for fun and to learn how to work with operating systems, digital audio, and artificial intelligence.
